Python Programming - Quick Notes

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It uses indentation to define blocks of code, making it clean and easy to understand. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Basic data types in Python include int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, set, and dict. Variables are dynamically typed, meaning you donâ€™t need to declare their type.

Common control structures include if-else, for and while loops. Functions are defined using the def keyword. Python also supports modules and packages for better code organization and reuse.

Popular libraries include NumPy (for numerical computing), Pandas (data analysis), Matplotlib (data visualization), and Flask/Django (web development).

Python is widely used in fields like web development, automation, machine learning, data science, and scripting due to its rich ecosystem and developer-friendly syntax.
